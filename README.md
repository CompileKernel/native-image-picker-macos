</p>

A macOS platform implementation of [`image_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker)
using the native system picker instead of the system open file dialog.

This package is an alternative to [`image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos)
which uses [`file_selector`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_selector).

> [!NOTE]
> This native picker depends on the photos in the [Photos for MacOS App](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/photos/), which uses the [Apple PhotosUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photosui) Picker, also known as PHPicker.

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ **Seamless Integration**  
  Effortlessly integrates with the [`image_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) package. Switch seamlessly between [`image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos) and this native platform implementation without modifying existing code.  
- üîí **No Permissions or Setup Required**  
  Requires no runtime permission prompts or entitlement configuration. Everything works out of the box.  
- üì± **macOS Photos App**  
  Enables picking images from the macOS Photos app, integrating with the Apple ecosystem and supporting photo imports from connected iOS devices.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Supports Image Options**  
  Adds support for image arguments like `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, and `imageQuality`‚Äîfeatures [not currently supported in `image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos#limitations).

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting started

Run the following command to add the dependencies:

```shell
$ flutter pub add image_picker image_picker_macos native_image_picker_macos
```

1. [`image_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker): The app-facing package for the Image Picker plugin which specifies the API used by Flutter apps.
2. [`image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos): The default macOS implementation of `image_picker`, built on [`file_selector`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_selector) and using [`NSOpenPanel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsopenpanel) with appropriate file type filters set. Lacks image resizing/compression options but supports older macOS versions.
3. [`native_image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/native_image_picker_macos): A macOS implementation of `image_picker`, built on [`PHPickerViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photosui/phpickerviewcontroller) which depends on the [Photos for macOS App](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/photos/). Supports image resizing/compression options. Requires macOS 13.0+.

Using both `image_picker_macos` and `native_image_picker_macos` can enable user-level opt-in to switch between implementations if the user prefers to pick images from the photos app or the file system.

<img src="https://github.com/CompileKernel/native-image-picker-macos/blob/main/readme_assets/use-native-macos-picker-switch-button.png?raw=true" alt="Use native macOS picker switch button" width="250">

The platform implementation `image_picker_macos` is required to ensure compatibility with macOS versions before 13.0, which is used as a fallback, in that case, it's necessary to [setup `image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos#entitlements).

> [!TIP]
> After registering this implementation as outlined in the [Usage](#-usage) section, you can [use the `image_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker#example) plugin as usual.

## üìú Usage

By default, this package doesn't replace the default implementation of [`image_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) for macOS to avoid conflict with [`image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos).

This implementation supports macOS 13 Ventura and later.

**To apply this package only in case it's supported on the current macOS version**:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await NativeImagePickerMacOS.registerWithIfSupported(); // ADD THIS LINE

  runApp(const MainApp());
}
```

**To checks if the current implementation of `image_picker` is `native_image_picker_macos`**:

```dart
final bool isRegistered = NativeImagePickerMacOS.isRegistered();

// OR

import 'package:image_picker_platform_interface/image_picker_platform_interface.dart';

final bool isRegistered = ImagePickerPlatform.instance is NativeImagePickerMacOS;
```

**To checks if the current macOS version supports this implementation**:

```dart
<!-- TODO: Make this instance method? -->
final bool isSupported = await NativeImagePickerMacOS().isSupported(); // Returns false on non-macOS platforms or if PHPicker is not supported on the current macOS version.
```

**To switch between `image_picker_macos` and `native_image_picker_macos` implementations**:

```dart
// NOTE: This code assumes the current target platform is macOS and native_image_picker_macos implementation is supported.

import 'package:image_picker_macos/image_picker_macos.dart';
import 'package:native_image_picker_macos/native_image_picker_macos.dart';

// To switch to image_picker_macos (supported on all macOS versions):

ImagePickerMacOS.registerWith();

// To switch to native_image_picker_macos (supported on macOS 13 and above):

NativeImagePickerMacOS.registerWith();

```

**To open the macOS photos app**:

```dart
await NativeImagePickerMacOS.instanceOrNull?.openPhotosApp();

// OR

final ImagePickerPlatform imagePickerImplementation = ImagePickerPlatform.instance;
if (imagePickerImplementation is NativeImagePickerMacOS) {
  await imagePickerImplementation.openPhotosApp();
}
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use `NativeImagePickerMacOS.registerWith()` to register this implementation. However, this bypasses platform checks, which **may result in runtime errors** if the current platform is not macOS or if the macOS version is unsupported. Instead, use `registerWithIfSupported()` if uncertain.

Refer to the [example main.dart](example/lib/main.dart) for a full usage example.

## üå± Contributing

This package uses [pigeon](https://pub.dev/packages/pigeon) for platform communication with the platform host and [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) for mocking in unit tests and [swift-format](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format) for formatting the Swift code.

```shell
$ dart run pigeon --input pigeons/messages.dart # To generate the required Dart and host-language code.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Limitations

* [Similarly to `image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos#limitations), `ImageSource.camera` is not supported [unless a `cameraDelegate` is set](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker#windows-macos-and-linux).
* [Similarly to `image_picker_macos`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_macos#pickvideo), the `maxDuration` argument in `pickVideo` is unsupported and will be silently ignored.

## üìö Additional information

This functionality was originally proposed as a [pull request to `image_picker_macos`](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/8079/), but it was later decided to split it into a community package which is unendorsed.

## üß™ Testing

> [!TIP]
> With this approach, you can effectively test this platform implementation with the existing packages that use `image_picker` APIs. All platform-specific calls to `NativeImagePickerMacOS` should use the instance from `ImagePickerPlatform.interface` instead of creating a new `NativeImagePickerMacOS` to work.

To override the methods implementation for unit testing, add the dev dependencies:

1. [`mockito`](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) (or [`mocktail`](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail)): for mocking the instance methods of `NativeImagePickerMacOS`.
2. [`image_picker_platform_interface`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_platform_interface): for overriding the instance of `ImagePickerPlatform` with the mock instance.
3. [`build_runner`](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner): for creating the generated Dart files.
4. [`plugin_platform_interface`](https://pub.dev/packages/plugin_platform_interface): Since `ImagePickerPlatform` extends `PlatformInterface`, it's required to apply the mixin `MockPlatformInterfaceMixin` to the mock of `NativeImagePickerMacOS` to [ignore an assertation failure that enforces the usage of `extends` instead of `implements`](https://pub.dev/packages/plugin_platform_interface), since mock classes need to extend `Mock` and implement the real class.

```shell
$ flutter pub add dev:mockito dev:image_picker_platform_interface dev:build_runner dev:plugin_platform_interface # Add them as dev-dependencies
```

In your test file, add this annotation somewhere:

```dart
import 'package:mockito/annotations.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
import 'package:native_image_picker_macos/native_image_picker_macos.dart';

@GenerateNiceMocks([MockSpec<NativeImagePickerMacOS>()])
```

Generate the `MockNativeImagePickerMacOS` by running:

```shell
$ dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Create a new instance of `MockNativeImagePickerMacOS` and override the instance of `ImagePickerPlatform` to every test:

```dart
import 'package:image_picker_platform_interface/image_picker_platform_interface.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  late MockNativeImagePickerMacOS mockNativeImagePickerMacOS;

  setUp(() {
    mockNativeImagePickerMacOS = MockNativeImagePickerMacOS();

    ImagePickerPlatform.instance = mockNativeImagePickerMacOS;
  });

  // Your tests, example:

  testWidgets(
    'pressing the open photos button calls openPhotosApp from $NativeImagePickerMacOS',
    (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester
          .pumpWidget(const ExampleWidget()); // REPLACE WITH THE TARGET WIDGET

      final openPhotosFinder =
          find.text('Open Photos App'); // REPLACE WITH THE BUTTON TEXT

      expect(openPhotosFinder, findsOneWidget);

      // Assuming the openPhotosApp call will success.
      when(mockNativeImagePickerMacOS.openPhotosApp())
          .thenAnswer((_) async => true);

      await tester.tap(openPhotosFinder);
      await tester.pump();

      verify(mockNativeImagePickerMacOS.openPhotosApp()).called(1);
      verifyNoMoreInteractions(mockNativeImagePickerMacOS);
    },
  );

  // ...
}
```

However, if you run the tests, you will get the following error:

```console
 Assertion failed: "Platform interfaces must not be implemented with `implements`"
```

And that is because  by default, all plugin platform interfaces that inherit from `PlatformInterface` must `extends` and not `implements` it to avoid breaking changes (adding new methods to platform interfaces are not considered breaking changes).

And mock classes must `implements` the real class rather than `extends` them, a solution is to [provide the mixin `MockPlatformInterfaceMixin` from `plugin_platform_interface` that will override this check](https://pub.dev/packages/plugin_platform_interface#mocking-or-faking-platform-interfaces):

```dart
import 'package:plugin_platform_interface/plugin_platform_interface.dart';

// This doesn't work yet since MockNativeImagePickerMacOS is generated, unlike the mocktail package.
class MockNativeImagePickerMacOS extends Mock
    with MockPlatformInterfaceMixin
    implements NativeImagePickerMacOS {}
```

And since `MockNativeImagePickerMacOS` is generated, we need a new class that extends the base mock and provides the `MockPlatformInterfaceMixin` for `plugin_platform_interface` to not throw the assertion failure:

```dart
@GenerateNiceMocks([MockSpec<NativeImagePickerMacOS>(as: Symbol('BaseMockNativeImagePickerMacOS'))]) // This name should be different than MockNativeImagePickerMacOS for the mockito generation to success
import '<current-test-file-name>.mocks.dart'; // REPLACE <current-test-file-name> with the current test file name without extension
import 'package:plugin_platform_interface/plugin_platform_interface.dart';

class MockNativeImagePickerMacOS extends BaseMockNativeImagePickerMacOS
    with MockPlatformInterfaceMixin {}

// Use MockNativeImagePickerMacOS instead of BaseMockNativeImagePickerMacOS for creating the mock of NativeImagePickerMacOS
```

Refer to the [example main_test.dart](example/test/main_test.dart) for the full example test.
